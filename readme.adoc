= plc4mat

[.none]
PLC4mat is a MATLAB wrapper for the PLC4x library written in C flavoured C++. 
Specifically it links to the C implamentation of PLC4x (PLC4c) for all PLC communication.

Included are a mex function for use in MATLAB (plc4mex) and S-function for use in Simulink (plc4sim).
The mex function allows use of 3 IO formats the use of which will depend on IO complexity.
The Simulink implamentation includes a masked library block to make use of plc4sim easier.

== Getting Started

To use plc4mat we first need to compile the two targets in MATLAB.

For plc4mex first compile the mex binary via:

    make_plc4mex

For plc4sim first compile in s-function via:

    make_plc4sim

These rely on the latest version of PLC4c, else compilation will fail.
Furthermore it is tested only on Linux.

== Using in MATLAB

Wwe can call the mex function as:

    plc4mex(function_name [, args ...])

The `function_name` argument can be:

[cols="1,2",options=header]
|===
| Function Name | Description
| `connect` | Initialise and connect to the PLC
| `status` | Return the status of the PLC connection
| `disconnect` | Disconnect from the PLC and free system
| `release` | Unlock the mex object so you can clear it, (locked in constructor)
| `read` | Read values as specified in arguments and return via output
| `write` | Write vales as specified in arguments
|===

You have some options for passing in required args to the IO functions (`read` & `write`):

* Structures
* Cell Arrays
* Name Value Pairs

[[plc4sim]]
== Using in Simulink 



The library block can be found in `plcLibrary.slx`. 
This block is masked so one can adjust parameters easily.

== Limitations

plc4mat (ie. plc4mex & plc4sim) support only TCP transport and the S7 protocol.

plc4mex supports only float values.

plc4sim doesn't support compound values (busses).
